## Dataset description
The data set consists of 1000 hypothetical datapoints, each of which contains scores from three standardized exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them. 

## Methodologies
Polynomial and Decision Tree Regression models are applied to find out what factors can influence studentsâ€™ SAT scores and at which rate. The process also consists of the comparison between two models' accuracies.
